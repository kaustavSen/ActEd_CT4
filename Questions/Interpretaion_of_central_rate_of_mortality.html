<p>On Page 13 of Chapter 7: Survival Models, the course notes states (interpretation of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-283">m_x</script>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the denominator <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-284">\int_0^1{_tp_x}dt</script> is interpreted as the expected amount of time spent alive between ages <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-285">x</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-286">x+1</script> by a life alive at age xâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am unable to comprehend how can <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-287">\int_0^1{_tp_x}dt</script> be thought of as an <em>expectation</em>? </p>
