On Page 13 of Chapter 7: Survival Models, the course notes states (interpretation of $m_x$):
>the denominator $\int_0^1{_tp_x}dt$ is interpreted as the expected amount of time spent alive between ages $x$ and $x+1$ by a life alive at age x...

I am unable to comprehend how can $\int_0^1{_tp_x}dt$ be thought of as an *expectation*?
